### -MONITORING-
Monitor the outdoor temperature & humidity around your motorcycle and your motor temperature.
All these parameters are visible on an Oled display that you attached to your steering bar and on the app Blynk.
These values are also tracked and plotted in the Blynk app.

### -ALARM SYSTEM-
The alarm system can be monitored and controlled via the Blynk app. It has a gyro sensor that triggers the alarm if the moto moves while the alarm is on. When there is an alarm, the Blynk app sends a push message to notify you. You can see the location of the moto on a map in the app.
